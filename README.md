# Animal Crossing: New Horizons tracker

## About

This project is a react implementation of a previous project of mine, written in only TypeScript. The aim of this project is to re-factor it into a react project and finish it to production, and host on Netlify or similar platform.

The program is developed by me, [Alexander Esbj√∂rnsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-esbjornsson/)

This application is aimed to "completionists" of the game Animal Crossint: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch.

The app helps keeping track of what critters can be caught in the game at certain points in time, and where to catch them in order to catch every single one.
The data in the app is pulled from from the Animal Crossing wiki: [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page)
